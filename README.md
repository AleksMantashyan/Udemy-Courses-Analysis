# udemy-courses-analysis
A data analysis project built in Python as a university group project for the DS120 course. It explores multiple Udemy course datasets (Business, Design, Music, Web Development) using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and basic statistics. Designed to practice EDA, visualization, and data-driven insights.

# DS120 Final Project – Udemy Courses Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a group project for our *Data Science 120 (DS120)* course. The goal is to explore and compare datasets from various Udemy course categories including Business, Design, Music, and Web Development. We applied data cleaning, EDA (exploratory data analysis), and visualizations to uncover patterns such as:

- Differences in course pricing
- Free vs Paid course engagement
- Subscriber counts by category
- Length and rating distribution
- Popularity trends over time
